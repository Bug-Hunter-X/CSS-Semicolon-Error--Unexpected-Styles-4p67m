Adding a semicolon after each style declaration solves the parsing error.

```css
.my-element {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

This ensures the CSS is parsed correctly, and the styles are applied as intended.  Always remember to use semicolons to separate style declarations in CSS for consistent and predictable results.
